# Qt-for-Python-Web-Browser
Web Browser Code in Qt for Python (PySide2) tutorial.

### Why?
    The first Web Browser example code in official tutorial at https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qtforpython/tutorials/examples/tabbedbrowser.html not able to run because of missing files. I replace the file from other places(e.g. webengineview.py only found in pastebin, https://pastebin.com/DPWTWhFa , lol this import is custome file and nothing to do with apt/pip packages!), and also fixed [doc] syntax error, update QWebXXX to QWebEngineXXX as stated at https://doc.qt.io/archives/qt-5.6/qtwebenginewidgets-qtwebkitportingguide.html
